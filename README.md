# perli &mdash; introduction

Perl REPL

# Installation

**Supported platforms**

* **Linux**, **OSX**, **Windows**

## Installation from the npm registry

With [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](https://iojs.org/) installed, install [the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/perli) as follows:

    [sudo] npm install perli -g

**Note**:

* Whether you need `sudo` depends on how you installed Node.js / io.js and whether you've [changed permissions later](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions); if you get an `EACCES` error, try again with `sudo`.
* The `-g` ensures [_global_ installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally) and is needed to put `perli` in your system's `$PATH`.

## Manual installation (Linux and OSX)

* Download [the CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mklement0/perli/stable/bin/perli) as `perli`.
* Make it executable with `chmod +x perli`.
* Move it or symlink it to a folder in your `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin` (OSX) or `/usr/bin` (Linux).
